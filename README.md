### MVP/PostMVP
 
#### MVP 
- The website will display a home page that greets the user and prompts them to select a recipe by catagory of protein (Poultry, Beef, Pork, Fish, ..etc).
- The user will select a category, and a list of recipes will render the selected criteria. 
- If the user clicks on the recipe item in the criteria list the user will be shown a  full rendered recipes info page, that will show a fully detailed view of the selected recipe. 
- The user will be able to add their own recipes to the webpage.

#### PostMVP  

- none (...at the moment.)
